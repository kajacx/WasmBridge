## Goals

The goal of this crate is to "run wasmtime on the web", that means **providing a unified API** for desktop and web runtimes.

With `wasm-bridge`, you can write a *single source code in Rust* that you would normally write when using wasmtime,
but it works on desktop as well as on the web.


## How do I use this?

In general, you would use this crate the same way wou would use `wasmtime`, and just replace `wasmtime` with `wasm_bridge`.

Alternatively, refer to this handy table:

| Use case | üìù Text tutorial | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Video tutorial | üßæ Full example | üìë Test cases |

## Alternatives

There are other options for loading and executing WASM modules on the desktop and on the web in RUST: `wasmer` can run on the web with the `js` feature flag, `wasmi` is an interpreter so it has no problem running on the web, and `wasm_component_layer` provides a unified API that can be "backed" by a number of "backends".

| Crate | Short description | Component model | Wasi support |
| ---   | ---               | ---             | ---          |
| `wasm-bridge` | Re-exports `wasmtime` on sys, `js-sys` impl on web. | Yes, but no resources. | Partially yes. |
| [`wasmer`](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) | Native impl in sys, `js-sys` impl on web. | They have [`wai` bindgen](https://github.com/wasmerio/wai). | [Yes](https://crates.io/crates/wasmer-wasi). |
| [`wasmi`](https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi) | Lightweight WASM interpreter, run anywhere. | [Planned](https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/issues/897). | Experimental [`wasmi_wasi`](https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi/tree/master/crates/wasi) crate. |
| [`wasm_runtime_layer`](https://github.com/DouglasDwyer/wasm_runtime_layer) | Thin wrapper around `wasmtime` or `wasmi`, `js-sys` impl on web. | [`wasm_component_layer`](https://github.com/DouglasDwyer/wasm_component_layer), but no bindgen. | Not to my knowledge. |
