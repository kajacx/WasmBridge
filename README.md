## Goals

The goal of this crate is to "run wasmtime on the web", that means **providing a unified API** for desktop and web runtimes.

With `wasm-bridge`, you can write a *single source code in Rust* that you would normally write when using wasmtime,
but it works on desktop as well as on the web.


## Component model

The main focus is to support [wasmtime's component model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model).
See the [Component model](/docs/component_model.md) page on how to get started.


## Non-component model use

The provided API is identical to wasmtime's API, so read [wasmtime's documentation](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/) on how to use this crate.

See [this page](/docs/wasm_modules.md) for an example usage.


## License

The source code of `wasm-bride` is licensed under MIT, but there are portions that are copied from other projects,
and may come with a different license.

Here is a full list of these exceptions:

- The [`wasmtime-component-macro`](/crates/wasm-bridge-macros/src/original) crate "fork".
