## Goals

The goal of this crate is to "run wasmtime on the web", that means **providing a unified API** for desktop and web runtimes.

With `wasm-bridge`, you can write a *single source code in Rust* that you would normally write when using wasmtime,
but it works on desktop as well as on the web.


## How do I use this?

In general, you would use this crate the same way wou would use `wasmtime`, and just replace `wasmtime` with `wasm_bride`.
